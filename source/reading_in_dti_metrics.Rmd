This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
dti <- read.csv("/projects/gherman/SPINS_human_phantoms/eddy_metrics.csv") %>% mutate(year=substr(session_label, 0, 6), site=substr(session_label, 7, 9), record_id=subject_id, parent_site=substr(session_label, 7, 8))%>% mutate(scanner_type= ifelse(substr(site,3,3)=="P", "prisma","GE")) %>% mutate(subj=subject_id)
```

OKAY time to annotate the DWI metrics based on this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918319451


"Such voxel-wise average voxel displacement summarises both rotations and translations at each voxel with a single scalar. Absolute (w.r.t. a reference volume) and relayeptive (w.r.t. the previous volume) total motions are calculated for each volume." 
<- I think framewise displacement would be relative, right?
The three metrics I should pull and plot: 

qc_mot_abs and *qc_mot_rel* using relative!
avg_snr_0 
svg_cnr_1000

```{r}

shapez=c("\u26AA","\u2605","\u2662","\u26AB","\u2606","\u2666") #cool so this works but not when the types are mixed
#OKAY so im gonna use unicode yayeart
names(shapez)=c("CMH","MRP","ZHH","CMP","MRC","ZHP")
fillz=c(NA,"black",NA,"black",NA,"black")
names(fillz)=c("CMH","MRP","ZHH","CMP","MRC","ZHP")




plot_mriqc_metric <- function(mriqc,metric){
  
  return (ggplot(data=mriqc, mapping = aes_string(x="subj", y=metric)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA, width=0.75, colour="gray82") + geom_jitter(width=0.3, aes( fill=site, shape=site), size=2)+theme_classic(base_size=10)+theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="white", colour="white"),axis.title.x=element_blank()) +scale_shape_manual(values=shapez)+scale_fill_manual(values=fillz) +guides(fill=guide_legend("title"), shape=guide_legend("title")))

}
```


```{r}
plot_mriqc_metric(dti, "avg_snr_0")
```
